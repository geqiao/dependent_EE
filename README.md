# Elementary Effects Method for Dependent Inputs

This repo contains the python implementation of the algorithm from the article

> Ge, Q. and M. Menendez (2017) Extending Morris method for qualitative global sensitivity analysis of models
> with dependent inputs. Reliability Engineering & Systems Safety, Vol. 162, pp. 28-39.

in which we introduced an efficient qualitative global sensitivity algorithm for models with dependent inputs.

For installation of depedent python package, use

> pipenv install

The main code are in `src` folder.
For the usage please refer to the `examples` folder.
